## __Game Description__



In this game, you will play as Son Gyon-Sung, a generic asian president. Son has two passions: baseball and missiles. Well, today we are not playing baseball.

The objective of this game is simple: you have to take the control of the whole world. Easy, right?. <br>

To make this possible, you will have some little friends: atomic bombs. <br>

Move across the map and when you run into another country's flag, who you gonna call? ðŸ’£

## __Game Motivation__



I've spent lots of hours playing bomberman, especially in my bus trips, tht's why I decided to develop a similar game, but updating it to nowadays.

This is the real Bomberman, in case you don't know it.
